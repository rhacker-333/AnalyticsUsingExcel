## Dataset Description
The dataset contains sales and profit data from an e-commerce business, including transaction details such as product categories, subcategories, sales amounts, profits, and regional sales data by state.

## What I Did
- Analyzed **sales and profit trends** to understand overall business performance.
- Examined **sales distribution across states** to identify regional patterns.
- Evaluated **profitability by product categories and subcategories** to pinpoint high and low-profit areas.
- Created **interactive Excel dashboards** featuring key metrics and visualizations such as pie charts and KPIs for quick insights.

This project provides actionable insights for data-driven decision-making in e-commerce through effective visualization and summary of sales and profit metrics.
