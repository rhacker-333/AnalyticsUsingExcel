# ExcelAnalytics

## Repository Overview
Here, I compile data analysis work, interactive dashboards, and visualization examples created in Microsoft Excel. The goal is to explore Excel’s capabilities in turning raw data into meaningful business insights using various charts, tables, and summary statistics.

## Background & Motivation
While studying at college, I worked with Excel—creating dashboards and experimenting with the platform’s visualization tools. As part of this exploration, I developed my first dashboard to learn the fundamentals of Excel data visualization and dashboard design. This hands-on practice helped me understand the process of building dashboards and the wide variety of chart types offered in Excel.

Later, I transitioned to using Tableau, a more advanced and widely adopted industry tool for business intelligence and data visualization. As a result, my focus shifted toward Tableau, and I completed more extensive projects there. However, Excel remains a powerful resource for building flexible, approachable dashboards—and I plan to continue expanding this repository with new and advanced Excel dashboard projects whenever I create them.

## What You'll Find Here
- Excel dashboards summarizing key business metrics and analysis.
- Demos of Excel visualization techniques using various chart types.

## Future Plans
Whenever I develop additional advanced dashboards or analytics tools in Excel, I will upload them here for sharing and documentation.
